Constant Density Fluid to perform the calibration.

Run with:
./DIC Examples/Constant/ 8 41 20 3 1 1 1 1 860 1850 360 2040 8 200 1e-10 0.99 5 1 1 0 1 1

to determine the calibration parameters and to calculate the index of refraction field. The resulting index of refraction field should be constant. The displacements fields are already provided.
